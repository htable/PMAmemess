PMA Memes App
The PMA Memes App is a React.js-based web application that allows users to upload and view memes. 
The application uses Realtime Firebase as the database and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Technologies Used
React.js: The application is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Firebase: The application uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve meme data.
Tailwind CSS: The application uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, for styling the user interface.
Vercel: The application is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions.
Components
The main components of the PMA Memes App are:

FirebaseConnector:
This component is responsible for connecting the application to the Firebase Realtime Database.
It initializes the Firebase app with the provided configuration and fetches data from the database.
The component uses the useEffect hook to perform the initialization and data fetching.
Feed:
This component is responsible for displaying the memes on the main feed.
It fetches the approved memes from the Firebase Realtime Database and sorts them by the number of likes in descending order.
The component also handles the like/unlike functionality for each meme.
It uses the useEffect hook to fetch the memes and the useState hook to manage the state of the memes, likes, and loading state.
Main.css:
This file contains the CSS styles for the application.
It includes styles for the main layout, header, meme display, upload form, and other UI elements.
The styles are primarily based on Tailwind CSS classes, but also include some custom styles.
Deployment
The PMA Memes App is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. 
Vercel automatically builds and deploys the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Database Structure
The Firebase Realtime Database stores the meme data in the following structure:


Copy code
memes/
  meme_id_1:
    id: meme_id_1
    author: "John Doe"
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/meme1.jpg"
    likes: 10
    approved: true
  meme_id_2:
    id: meme_id_2
    author: "Jane Smith"
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/meme2.jpg"
    likes: 5
    approved: false
Each meme is stored as a child of the "memes" node, with a unique ID as the key. 
The meme data includes the author, image URL, number of likes, and an "approved" flag to indicate whether the meme has been approved for display.
